# Data Cleaning SQL Project 

This project involves cleaning and preparing a real-world dataset on global layoffs using MySQL. The primary goal is to ensure the data is in a usable format for further analysis and visualization. The project includes the following steps:

## Database and Table Setup
- Created a new schema and table in MySQL to store the dataset.
- Imported the raw data into the table.

## Data Cleaning Steps
1. **Remove Duplicates**: Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
2. **Standardize Data**: Ensured consistency in data formatting, such as standardizing industry names.
3. **Handle Null Values**: Addressed null and blank values appropriately, either by removing or filling them with meaningful data.
4. **Date Formatting**: Converted date columns from text to date format to facilitate time-series analysis.

## Staging Table
- Created a staging table to perform all cleaning operations without altering the raw data, maintaining a backup of the original dataset.

## Final Clean Data
- Ensured the dataset was free of inconsistencies, properly formatted, and ready for exploratory data analysis.

- The cleaned dataset is now prepared for subsequent analysis to uncover trends and patterns in global layoffs.
